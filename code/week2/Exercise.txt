1) Create angular filters:

title case: 

	This filter should capitalise the first character in every word. It should also capitalise words seperated by a - . All other characters should be lowercase. 

	tOm bLacKMore = Tom Blackmore 

	john-christian johnsson = John-Christian Johnsson


unique :

	This filter returns a string arrary removing duplicates.


2) Seperate the filters into there own module that lives in a seperate directory. Add jasmine unit tests to test the functions work as you want.

See KarmaJasmineAngular-manual-setup.js for getting started.
