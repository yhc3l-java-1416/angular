When you open your app you should see the items that you need to buy and add item button.

For each item in the list you should be able to:
	a) see the information about the item, either directly or in a sub page, 
	b) be able to check it (to say you have bought it).
	c) be able to delete it (you no longer want to buy it).

When you click on the add item button the user should be presented with a form with name, stockist and quantity.
